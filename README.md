# Campfire_Song-SBSP
I call this one, the campfire song song
Let's gather 'round the campfire, and sing our campfire song
Our C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E S-O-N-G song
And if you don't think that we can sing it faster then you're wrong
But it'll help if you just sing along
Bum, bum, buuum...
Out in the forest, down by the river
Sound of water, smell of trees
I can garuntee with me we will get faster and faster
Lets gather 'round this campfire and thanks for singing along
